--Description 

  --Memory game, also known as concentration card game or matching game,
  is a simple card game in which you must match pairs by turning over two cards at a time. 


--Instructions
You do not need to install anything to play this game.


Rules:
You start by turning over a card.
If the next card you turn over matches, it tells you that you have found a pair.

If the next card you turn over doesn't match, you get another note to try again and the cards are turned over.
The game continues until you match all the cards on the board.
You have one minute to find all the pairs and try to have as less cards flipped as possible.
